					<p>A scene that uses music to dramatize would be when Ponyboy and Johnny go into the burning church to save the children. As soon as they arrive at the church very intense music begins playing. The song uses disjunct methods to give meaning to the scene, and it also has very sudden changes in volume when something important happens. This can be seen at around 1:45 when a burning plank falls right next to Ponyboy. The music also has very repetitive trumpets that slowly get louder to make the listener anxious. At 1:56 you can also hear the dies irae, a very famous melody that is used to represent death and has been used for over 800 years. All of these factors together make this scene very dramatic, and makes the listener very anxious.</p>

					<p>A scene that uses sound effects to dramatize would be during the rumble. Throughout this scene there is lots of fighting, and to give the fighting a bigger impact on the viewer, they added sound effects. You can clearly hear the sound effects when there is punching or kicking, and you can also hear how some sound effects are reused. From listening to it, I was able to identify three unique punching sounds, and I’m pretty sure they only used those three. On top of the fighting and the very loud music, there was a lot of rain, which was quietly added into the background. There was also one part where a person’s face was being smashed into a puddle of mud, and the sound effects people had a hard time because the sounds of mud weren’t in sync with the person’s face being smashed into it. Finally, on top of all of this, there was a lot of yelling and screaming added on top of the fighting to make it sound more realistic.</p>

					<hr class="text-hr">
					<p>A scene that uses lighting to dramatize it would be when Dally gets shot under the streetlight. The scene happens when Dally finds out that Johnny dies. Most of the “gang” goes back to the Curtis house, but Dally goes to a store. In the movies they show how Dally robs the store and then gets the cops called on him. He manages to find a phone and calls Curtis home. He tells them to meet him at the parking lot where Johnny and Ponyboy had fallen asleep a while ago. When everyone arrives they find Dally running away from the cops. He turns around and pulls out his gun and points it at the police, and the police begin shooting. Dallas drops dead and there’s just one streetlight shining on his dead body and the rest of the “gang” standing around him. In this scene it is night time and there is a thick layer of fog. The bright streetlights cast down on the scene from above, giving a very spooky feeling. They also added a lot of blue light in the background to set a sort of melancholy mood to the scene, adding on to the dramatizing music. All together, this makes the scene a very dramatic death for dally.</p>

					<p>A scene that uses camera angles to dramatize would be when Ponyboy recites the poem “Nothing Gold Can Stay” by Robert Frost. In this scene we first get a silhouette shot of Johnny coming up to Ponyboy on the hill. We can’t see their face or their body, it's all black. In the background we can see a very intense orange sky. This scene really sets the mood for the poem. After that we get a close up shot of Johnny and Ponyboy as they exchange a few words. This time we can see their faces. After that the scene focuses only on Ponyboy as he recites the poem. While he does so, very intense music is playing. Between shots there are very slow fade transitions to fit with the cozy mood.</p>

					<p>A scene that uses special effects to dramatize would be when Bob was killed. In this scene, Ponyboy was being drowned. We could see him struggling really hard, and then suddenly the fountain is covered with blood. These special effects add in enormous amounts of blood that would be very hard to implement without special effects. This blood really adds to the scene and makes it a lot spookier. It goes from this very intense drowning where Ponyboy is barely alive, and then we get a shot of Johnny looking at his knife. Then this action abruptly ends with a pool of blood.</p>

					<hr class="text-hr">
					<p>I believe that the movie was not as effective in delivering the story as the book. As a first point, it is very difficult to make a book into an excellent movie, because all those who have read the book first will notice when details are missing. In this case it is even more prominent because it is a first person story. In first person stories the thoughts the character is having are very important, and eliminating those, especially in this story, is very detrimental. Throughout the movie many important details are lost just to save time. For example, when Ponyboy talks to Cherry at the popcorn place, many details such as Ponyboy talking about Johnny getting mugged were skipped over, even though they are very important to the story. All these small details that have been removed seem small and insignificant to the director who needs to cut down the movie length, but for the viewer, those small details are really what puts the movie together.</p>
